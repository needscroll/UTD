program is written in java
main file is called "launcher.java"
please launch the program from this file and place input program files in the same directory as launching file

the file labeled CustomProgram.txt is the custom program I wrote for the project
The folder labeled "my results from running program 4" contains the output of the program on on sample4.txt
for some reason, changing the interrupt time affects sample4 which is why I wanted to include the results I got from running it
at the bottom of the output file there should be the correct result where the program exits on user attempting to acess address 1000 while not in kernal mode
