Assignment instruction
----------------------

In this part, we have figure a way to call the `solve` binary. 

You will exploit the vulnerable `part0x01` binary with elevated privileges
(so that you can invoke `solve` binary).

`part0x01` task its input from standard input (stdin). 

To run it and provide your payload, simply do something of the following:
  $ ./part0x01
  CS6332 Crackme Level 0x01
  Password:payload
  Invalid Password!

or 

  $ echo -ne 'your payload\x33' | ./part0x01
  CS6332 Crackme Level 0x00
  Password:Invalid Password!

Now the binary has a buffer overflow bug, how can you redirect control flow to
make it call the solve binary?

Submission
----------

On a successful exploitation, the program will run `solve` program which will
ask you to provide your NetID and return your hash value. For this part of
assignment, i please submit the followings

  1. Your *input* to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability
  2. Hash value generated by *solve* as a return for your NetID.
