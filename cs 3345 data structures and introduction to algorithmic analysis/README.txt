Notes:
As the size of the array increases the time taken to sort the list also increases.
The rate of increasing appears to be some factor of log n.
Furthermore, randomly choosing the elements seems to result in a longer run time
most likely since generating random numbers takes time.
This appears to be the case with small arrays.
for small arrays, the quickest sort was the book sort most likely since
it has an improvement over the first element sort but doesn't need
to generate random numbers.
