the algorithm works as such
in each round, all nodes broadcast a message to their neighbors and then wait to recieve messages
the node will wait until it has recieved a message back from all it's neighbors before advancing to the next round
in the next round, the node repeats the process by broadcasting a message and then waiting
this happens for n rounds
Each node logs every message it gets
at the end of n rounds, the node will go through the message log to compute the k hop neighbors and the ecentricity
